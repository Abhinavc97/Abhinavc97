Hi there 👋 </br>
I'm a passionate defender of digital frontiers, currently pursuing my Master’s in Cybersecurity at The George Washington University 👨‍🎓🔐. With hands-on experience from Infosys as a Senior System Engineer and a growing portfolio of offensive and defensive security projects, I thrive at the intersection of code, curiosity, and cyber threats .

Whether it’s diving deep into security concepts or simulating phishing campaigns with GoPhish 🎯📧 or building visual traceroute maps on 3D globes 🌍, I love crafting tools that are as effective as they are exciting.

I’ve got a sharp analytical mindset and a natural talent for solving complex problems. These qualities make me a strong asset to any cybersecurity team. I thrive on challenges and am always exploring new ways to sharpen my skills and expand my expertise in this fast-evolving field �.

If you’re looking for a dedicated cybersecurity professional who’s ready to help you stay one step ahead of threats, let’s connect and work together to build a safer, smarter digital world 🤝.
